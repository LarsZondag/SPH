    "Computational fluid dynamics is a hot topic in Computer Graphics. The capability to reproduce realistic fluids numerically has gained an increased interest the last decade. Grid-based methods have been favored the most to solve the mathematical equations for fluid flow, but often they lack the ability to create interactive fluid simulations together with detailed fluid surfaces. Interactive fluid dynamics is of essential interest in real-time applications, such as computer games or virtual surgery simulators. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, it is posible to implement a stable particle-based approach to solve the motion of interactive fluids.\n",
